   This data was obtained through a carefully designed experiment involving
three-component mixtures of metal ions (Co(II), Cr(III), Ni(II)), a system 
suggested from the work of Osten and Kowalski [1].  Stock solutions of the 
nitrates were prepared with concentrations of 0.172, 0.0764, and 0.393 M 
for Co, Ni and Cr respectively, in 4% nitric acid.  All chemicals used 
were analytical reagent grade or better.  A three-level, three-factor 
calibration design was used in which 1, 3, or 5 mL aliquots of the various 
stock solutions were combined and diluted to 25 mL with 4% nitric acid.  
Unfortunately, insufficient Ni stock remained for one solution 
(3:5:5 Co:Cr:Ni), so the calibration set consisted of 26 rather than 27 
solutions.  Final concentration ranges were 6.88 to 34.40 mM for Co, 3.06 to 
15.29 mM for Cr, and 15.70 to 78.8 mM for Ni.  Five replicate spectra were 
obtained for each sample using randomized blocks (i.e. 5 blocks of all 26 
solutions, randomly ordered within each block). To minimize the effects of 
instrumental drift, a reference spectrum was run prior to each new sample.  
Spectra were recorded over the range of 300-650 nm on a HP 8452 diode array 
spectrophotometer (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA range : 190-820 nm) using a standard 1 cm 
quartz cuvette.  Measurements were made at 2nm intervals with a 1 s 
integration time.
